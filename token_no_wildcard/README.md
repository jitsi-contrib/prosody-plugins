# Token No Wildcard

This plugin pre-validates tokens and rejects any token that uses wildcards (`'*'`) for `room` or `sub` claim, or if
regex-based matching is requested.

In effect, it insists that all tokens can only be used for one specific room thus reducing the blast radius should
someone accidentally share their token.
