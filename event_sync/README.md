# Event Sync

This prosody component sends HTTP POST request with JSON payload to external API when occupant or room events are triggered.

If JWT token auth is used, `name`, `email` and `id` from the user context is also included in the JSON
payload for occupant data.

    }
    api_timeout = 10  -- timeout if API does not respond within 10s
    retry_count = 5  -- retry up to 5 times
    api_retry_delay = 1  -- wait 1s between retries
    
    -- change retry rules so we also retry if endpoint returns HTTP 408
